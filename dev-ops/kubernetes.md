**Clusters:**

 A collection of Docker hosts exposed as if it were a single virtual Docker host, so that the application can scale to multiple instances of the services spread across multiple hosts within the cluster. 
 
 Docker clusters can be created with Kubernetes, Azure Service Fabric, Docker Swarm and Mesosphere DC/OS.

**Orchestrator: **

A tool that simplifies management of clusters and Docker hosts. Orchestrators enable you to manage their images, containers, and hosts through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI. 

You can manage container networking, configurations, load balancing, service discovery, high availability, Docker host configuration, and more. 

An orchestrator is responsible for running, distributing, scaling, and healing workloads across a collection of nodes. 

Typically, orchestrator products are the same products that provide cluster infrastructure, like Kubernetes and Azure Service Fabric, among other offerings in the market.

## Kubernetes:
A container Orchestration technology which manages containers and deploys them on multiple hosts . Docker is mainly used as container technology
It automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking tasks of containers.
